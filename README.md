# BlazePose: Body Segmentation for TFJS and NodeJS

Models included in `/model/*` were converted to TFJS Graph model format from the original repository  
Models descriptors and signature have been additionally parsed for readability

Actual model parsing implementation in `blazepose.js` does not follow original  
and is implemented using native TFJS ops and optimized for JavaScript execution
